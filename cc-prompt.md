As a software developer, I need your help to design a comprehensive system to track conversations handled by AI agents across various platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Direct messages. This system must address the following key requirements:
1. Conversation Qualification:
   * Implement a mechanism to classify each conversation based on its importance:
      * High priority: Urgent issues or critical customer queries.
      * Medium priority: General inquiries or standard support requests.
      * Low priority: Non-urgent matters or informational queries.
2. File Management:
   * Ensure the system can securely store files exchanged during conversations, specifically those requested by the AI during interactions. Files should be associated with relevant conversations for easy retrieval.
3. Customer Data Management:
   * Create functionality to capture and store essential customer information gathered during conversations. This includes:
      * Basic details (name, contact information).
      * Relevant context (previous interactions, preferences).
      * Any additional data pertinent to personalized service delivery.
4. Pending Follow-ups:
   * Develop a feature to flag conversations that require follow-up actions or pending resolutions. The system should notify users about these pending tasks to ensure timely responses.

## UX and User Experience with modern concepts and best practices
As a user, I want to have a seamless experience interacting with the system, including:
1. User-Friendly Interface:
   * The system should offer a user-friendly interface with clear navigation and easy-to-use controls.
2. Responsive Design:
   * The interface should be optimized for various screen sizes and devices to ensure a consistent and enjoyable experience across different platforms and screen resolutions.
3. Real-time Updates:
   * The system should provide real-time updates and notifications to users, including conversation status changes, new messages, and pending follow-ups.
4. Accessibility and Localization:
   * The interface should be accessible to users with disabilities and support multiple languages and regional variations.
5. Personalization:
   * The system should adapt to user preferences, such as language, time zone, and preferred communication channels.
6. Error Handling:
   * The system should provide clear and informative error messages to users when they encounter issues or unexpected circumstances.
